        h1 What does the Czar do

        p The Czar's job is to look at all of the user's preferences and create a schedule for the week. When you are creating the schedule, you have to balance many different competing priorities. Here is an ordered list of priorities to consider:
        ol
          li Individual constraints come first. Once in a while if you really really want to violate a constraint, email/call the person to check if that is ok.
          li Minimize number of cars required.
          li Individual preferences come next (e.g. preferences to leave a certain time or to drive or not to drive).
          li Balance cumulative driving statistics so that everyone has roughly the same driving percentage. (Refer to the statistics sheet for the semester.)
          li Avoid someone driving home alone from 3:30-6:30pm because of heavy traffic in the late afternoon/evening to Pasadena. That allows the person to use carpool lane.
          li Avoid someone driving too many times in one week if possible.
          li Group people who are from the same campus for convenience of drop off in AM/pick up in PM.
          li Cars can go solo in the morning and that saves a trip to the carpool spot, so try to let cars go solo in the AM.
          li Balance cars so they are not too squished (some cars can seat 5 comfortably).

        h1 How do you make a schudule / use the Czar tools?

        p This tutorial is designed to give you a visual guide of how to use the tools properly to help create cars easily and efficently. The first step in this tutorial is to open the example czar page in a new tab. To do this #[a(href='/exampleCzar') Right click here ] and select "open in new tab". We will manipulate the results in this page so that we can learn the tools.

        
        p The first step in this tutorial is to get familiar with the Czar page enviroment. Notice that there are two tables with gray and blue boxes, The top table corresponds to cars leaving Pasedena in the morning and the bottom table corresponds to cars leaving Claremont in the afternoon. In these tables the blue boxes represent times where a user has indicated they are willing to leave at while the gray boxes represent times in which the user does not want to leave. We also have a Monday Cars area at the bottom of the page which is empty. On the real Czar Page you will have multiple days of information which you will have to manage, but for this example we are only going to worry about one day.

        p Lets make our first car. lets say we want to make a car leaving Pasedena at 7:15 where Caroline is driving and Estrid and Katie are passengers. To do this We can start by finding the column at the time 7:15 and go down and click on the blue box in the rows with names Caroline, Estrid and Kaite. Notice that you can see which box you are about to click by looking for the black borders around the blue box. When you click the three boxes your screen should look as follows:

        img(src= "/images/tut1.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p If your screen does not look like this because a box has red borders instead of yellow or you accidentally clicked the wrong box do not worry, you can deselect a box by clicking it until the boarders become black again. The yellow boardering around the boxes you clicked represents that these people will be passengers leaving in a car at this time. We want Caroline to be driver, so click the yellow box on caroline's row again, which will turn it red, meaning that she is the driver. Your screen should look like this:

        img(src= "/images/tut2.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p Now press the Finish Car button! a lot just changed, lets break it down into three parts. First lets take a look at the am table:

        img(src= "/images/tut3.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p We see that all the blocks in the row of people who we just added to a car have changed to green blocks. These green blocks signfy that the user already has a ride leaving pasadena in the morning. In order to stop you from accidently putting someone in two cars you are not able to select green blocks. Now lets look at the PM table

        img(src= "/images/tut4.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p We see that along with the normal blue boxes there are now purple boxes and brownish gold boxes. The purple boxes signify that the person is a driver of a car going in the other direction, so therefore we know that this person must be a driver of a car going in this direction. Simmilarly the gold boxes represent that the preson is a passenger going in the other direction so they must also be a passenger in this direction. Now lets look at the last part of the screen which is the "monday cars" table.

        img(src= "/images/tut5.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p We now see the car we have just made, notice that it includes the time and the names of the people in the car. Also notice that if we click on this car it becomes red. This means that this car is selected and if we now go up and press the delete car button then this car will be removed and everything will be reset. If you want to deselect a car click it again, which will make it black again. try deleting this car.

        p Another important part of the Czar tools is the error checking which stops you from doing invalid things like trying to make two cars at once, or making someone who cannot drive drive and so forth. Lets try to make the error checking go off. To do this try to make car leaving claremont at 4:30pm with Guthrie as a driver and Doren as a passenger. Your pm timetable should look like the following before you press finish car:

        img(src= "/images/tut6.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p Now when you press finish car you will get the following pop-up:

        img(src= "/images/tut7.png" width = "50%" height = "50%")

        p This error came up because as you can see on the right side of the table there is a note saying Guthrie cannot drive. This is a preference which he indicated on his fourm page. simmilar preferneces such as must drive will be indicated there as well so make sure to read thoes notes before adding people. There are many other errors which can happen but hopefully after reading the error message you will be able to figure out what you did wrong. In very rare cases you may need to overide error checking. In this case simply click the Override Error Checking box before pressing finish car. You should only use this if you are absolutly sure that you should be doing what you are doing, and the for some reason the error checker will not let you.

        p This complete your Czar tools tutorial, for practice you may want to find a complete set of cars for this day. You will know you succeed when all of the boxes are green. Also try to aviod having cars with only one person in it. When you think you have succedded click the Submit Schudule button at the bottom of the page which will check to make sure that you put everone in a car and will route you to the schedule page if you have suceeded.
